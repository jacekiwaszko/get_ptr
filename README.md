get_ptr.sh â€” A simple Bash script for performing forward and reverse DNS lookups.
It takes an IP address or hostname and retrieves associated A, AAAA, and PTR records, showing the results in a clean, color-formatted output. Useful for quick DNS inspections, troubleshooting, and verifying reverse DNS (PTR) mappings.
